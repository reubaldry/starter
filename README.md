# ðŸ’¤ LazyVim

A starter template for [LazyVim](https://github.com/LazyVim/LazyVim).
Refer to the [documentation](https://lazyvim.github.io/installation) to get started.

## Notes:

This configuration is mostly stock LazyVim, with a few minor changes. It probably isn't worth using this fork as your own config, but it may be nice for some inspiration.

I've got vimtex installed on my setup, which needs a bit more setting up than just installing the plugin.
If you want to use it I'd recommend finding a guide somewhere on getting it set up.
